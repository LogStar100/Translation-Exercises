  			<p>Margaret Atwood is a famed Canadian writer whose works usually encompass themes like gender, identity, religion, and "power politics." This book in particular fictionalizes the 1843 murders of a husband and wife in Canada West; two of their servants were convicted and hanged. Note the usage of "faux Victorian" English &ndash; enough antiquated terms are used to set the scene, but not enough to distract the viewer. Keep this in mind during your translation.</p>

          That <a href="#fakeID">went on</a> well enough <a href="#fakeID">for</a> a time, but I began to be <a href="#fakeID">uneasy</a>, as Mr. Haraghy attempted <a href="#fakeID">liberties</a> in the back <a href="#fakeID">passage</a> while I was <a href="#fakeID">carrying out</a> the dishes from the dining room; and <a href="#fakeID">although</a> I remembered Mary's advice about <a href="#fakeID">kicking</a> between the legs, I thought it would not be right to kick my employer, and might also lead to <a href="#fakeID">dismissal</a> without a reference. But then one night I <a href="#fakeID">heard</a> him outside the door of my attic chamber; I recognized his <a href="#fakeID">wheezy</a> <a href="#fakeID">cough</a>. He was <a href="#fakeID">fumbling</a> with the <a href="#fakeID">latch</a> of the door. I always <a href="#fakeID">locked myself in</a> at night, but I knew that lock or no lock, sooner or later he would find a way of getting in, with a <a href="#fakeID">ladder</a> if nothing else, and I couldn't sleep easy <a href="#fakeID">for</a> <a href="#fakeID">thinking</a> of it; and I needed my sleep, as I was very tired from the <a href="#fakeID">day's work</a>; and once <a href="#fakeID">you</a> are found with a man in your room <a href="#fakeID">you are</a> the guilty one, <a href="#fakeID">no matter</a> how they get in. As Mary used to say, there are some of the masters who think you owe them service <a href="#fakeID">twenty-four</a> hours a day, and should do the main work <a href="#fakeID">flat on your back</a>.

        <p><strong>went on</strong> Watch the tense here: since it refers to a discrete period of time in the past, you should use the preterite.</p>
        <p><strong>for</strong> <em>durante</em> is probably better than <em>por</em> here due to the implication of a long period of time; however, either could work well here depending on if that mood is invoked throughout the rest of the passage.</p>
        <p><strong>uneasy</strong> A number of possibilities: <em>nerviosa, incómoda, desasosegada</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>liberties</strong> This has a clear sexual connotation in English which must be rendered in Spanish. Perhaps the most exact equivalent is <em>propasarse</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>passage</strong> <em>pasillo</em> not <em>pasaje</em> (that refers to literature/voyages)</p>
        <p><strong>carrying out</strong> Difficult to render economically: <em>retirar, recoger, quitar,</em> or <em>llevar</em> are appropriate. <em>traer</em> cannot be used, as it always means "bring to the place where we are speaking," never "take to another place." <em>cargar</em> doesn't give the idea of direction, although <em>salir cargada de platos</em> might work.</p>
        <p><strong>although</strong> No subjunctive necessary: she <u>did</u> remember Mary's advice.</p>
        <p><strong>kicking</strong> <em>dar una patada</em> is certainly most common, but a construction with <em>puntapié</em> works well.</p>
        <p><strong>dismissal</strong> Probably better to use a verbal construction here.</p>
        <p><strong>heard</strong> This isn't French &ndash; <em>entender</em> is not the word!</p>
        <p><strong>wheezy</strong> Requires careful translation: <em>resollante</em> is perhaps the closest; <em>asmático</em> is accurate but unfortunately lacks the onomatopoeic quality of the English.</p>
        <p><strong>cough</strong> <em>la tos</em>, not <em>*el tos</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>fumbling</strong> Must be rendered by some paraphrase like <em>manosear con torpeza</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>latch</strong> <em>pasador</em> or <em>pestillo</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>locked myself in</strong> <em>me encerraba</em> rather than just <em>cerraba la puerta</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>ladder</strong> <em>escalera</em> (<em>escalón</em> is just a rung).</p>
        <p><strong>for</strong> <em>por</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>thinking</strong> A preposition is always followed by the infinitive in Spanish, never the gerund. "think of" is <em>pensar en</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>day's work</strong> Could be economically translated by <em>mi jornada</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>you</strong> This passage is fairly colloquial, so you can use <em>tú</em>: "si te descubren/sorpreden;" for that same reason it is inappropriate to use the <em>ser</em> passive.</p>
        <p><strong>you are</strong> Try to bring out the contrastive stress of the original by a change in word order: <em>eres tú la culpable / la culpable eres tú</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>no matter</strong> <em>comoquiera que entren</em> is most economical, but more long-winded ones give an opportunity to use <em>este</em> pejoratively.</p>
        <p><strong>twenty-four</strong> <em>veinticuatro</em> with an 'i.'</p>
        <p><strong>flat on your back</strong> <em>boca arriba</em> is the standard expression.</p>
